ERTOS baremetal stm32f103c8t6 "bluepill"

Prerequisites are gcc, gdb and openocd.

Connections:

* Connect ST-LINK V2 to onboard debugger
* Connect UART TX A2, RX A3

Compile using `make all`, this will output firmware as well as an
objdump file for inspection.

For OpenOCD with STLINK-V2 debugging there is a systemd service file
provided which you should change to match the location of the
openocd.cfg for the device before installing (--user).

The custom openocd.cfg is becuase my chip is not a real bluepill but a
clone. Once the service file is installed the server will be started
and stopped automatically when you open gdb. See .gdbinit for details,
or delete it if you dont install the service file and do it another
way.

You can flash the decvice in gdb by calling the flash function defined
in the gdb init file. Read this file to see the startup proceedure.

## Usage

make all
systemctl --user start stm32f103c8t6_openocd.service
gdb
continue

make screen # (use C-a ? to get screen keybinds, hint: C-a k to quit)
